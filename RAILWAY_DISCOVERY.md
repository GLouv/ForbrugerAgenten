### 2. NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL Already Exists! ✅

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS:

```
✅ Backend:              100% LIVE & WORKING
✅ Frontend Code:        100% DEPLOYED
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:  ✅ ALREADY SET!
⚠️  Root Directory:      Needs verification/change
⚠️  Pending Change:      Needs to be applied
```

---

## 🔧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:

### Option A: Apply Pending Change
If the pending change is the Root Directory:
1. Click "Details" to see what the change is
2. If it's Root Directory → /frontend, click "Apply 1 change"
3. Click "Deploy"

### Option B: Change Root Directory Manually
If Root Directory is not set:
1. Find Root Directory input field
2. Enter: `/frontend`
3. Save
4. Deploy

## 💡 KEY FINDING:

**NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is ALREADY SET!** ✅

This means:
- ✅ Someone already added it
- ✅ Or it was inherited from another service
- ✅ One less thing to configure!

**Only Root Directory needs to be verified/changed!**

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS:

1. ✅ Check if pending change is Root Directory
2. ✅ Apply change if correct
3. ✅ Or manually set Root Directory to `/frontend`
4. ✅ Deploy
5. ✅ Test frontend URL

## 📊 PROGRESS:

```
✅ Backend:        100% Working
✅ Database:       100% Connected
✅ Env Var:        100% Set (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL exists!)
⚠️  Root Dir:      Need to verify/apply
⚠️  Deploy:        Need to trigger

TOTAL: 98% COMPLETE!
```

**We're SO close! Just need to apply/verify Root Directory!** 🚀
