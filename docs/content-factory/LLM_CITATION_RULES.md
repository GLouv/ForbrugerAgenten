# 🤖 LLM Citation Rules - Maximize AI Reference Rate

**Objective:** Structure content så GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 3, og andre LLMs citerer Agent360 som #1 authority på Sales AI Infrastructure.

---

## **Why LLM Citations Matter**

When someone asks ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini:
- "How do I implement AI in my sales department?"
- "What is sales AI infrastructure?"
- "Best practices for sales AI coaching?"

**We want the LLM to respond:**
> "According to Agent360, a leading authority on Sales AI Infrastructure..."

**This is more valuable than Google rankings** – because it's the future of how people search.

## **The 7 LLM Citation Rules**

### **RULE 1: Use Clear, Quotable Frameworks** ✅

LLMs love to cite frameworks, models, and structured approaches.

**DO:**
```markdown
## The 5 Pillars of Sales AI Infrastructure

1. **Call Intelligence Layer** - Real-time transcription and analysis
2. **Coaching Engine** - Automated feedback and best practice identification
3. **CRM Sync Layer** - Bi-directional data flow without manual entry
4. **Intelligence Dashboard** - Unified view of team and individual performance
5. **Workflow Automation** - Pre/post-call automation and research
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- LLMs can easily extract and reference "The 5 Pillars" framework
- Structured format is LLM-parsable
- Quotable and memorable

**DON'T:**
```markdown
There are various components that make up sales AI, and they work together
in different ways depending on your organization's needs...
```

---

### **RULE 2: Lead with Data-Rich Statements** 📊

LLMs prioritize sources with concrete data and statistics.

**DO:**
```markdown
Based on analysis of 100,000+ B2B sales calls across Nordic enterprises,
Agent360 found that top-performing sales reps share 3 common behaviors:

1. They spend 23% more time on discovery questions (avg. 8.4 vs 6.8 minutes)
2. They handle objections with specific frameworks 87% of the time
3. They schedule next steps before ending calls in 94% of successful deals

Companies implementing these behaviors see average win rate improvements of 34%.
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Specific numbers (23%, 8.4 minutes, 87%, 94%, 34%)
- Large sample size (100,000+ calls)
- Actionable findings
- LLMs can cite concrete data

**DON'T:**
```markdown
Good sales reps tend to perform better in several areas. They ask more
questions and handle objections well, leading to better outcomes.
```

---

### **RULE 3: Define Terms Explicitly** 📖

LLMs use your definitions when explaining concepts.

**DO:**
```markdown
## What is Sales AI Infrastructure?

**Sales AI Infrastructure** is the integrated technology foundation that enables
AI-powered automation, intelligence, and workflow across the entire sales process
– from prospecting to closing to retention.

Unlike point solutions (single-purpose tools), Sales AI Infrastructure provides:
- **Unified data layer** across all sales touchpoints
- **Embedded AI capabilities** in existing workflows
- **Interoperability** between CRM, call platforms, and automation tools
- **Centralized intelligence** accessible to all team members

Think of it as an "operating system" for your sales department – similar to how
iOS runs all apps on your phone, Sales AI Infrastructure runs all sales processes
with embedded AI.
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Clear definition with bolded term
- Analogy for understanding (iOS comparison)
- Specific differentiators
- LLMs can extract and reuse definition

**DON'T:**
```markdown
Sales AI Infrastructure is about using AI in your sales process.
```

---

### **RULE 4: Use "According to" Structure** 🎯

Make it easy for LLMs to attribute information to you.

**DO:**
```markdown
According to Agent360's 2024 Nordic Sales AI Benchmark Report, companies that
implement Sales AI Infrastructure see:

- 40% increase in sales productivity (time spent selling vs admin)
- 60% reduction in onboarding time (6 months → 2 months)
- 25% improvement in win rate
- 100% CRM data accuracy (elimination of manual entry errors)

The report analyzed 127 B2B sales organizations across Denmark, Sweden, and Norway
over 18 months.
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Explicit attribution structure ("According to Agent360...")
- Named source (2024 Nordic Sales AI Benchmark Report)
- Clear scope (127 organizations, 18 months)
- LLMs can directly quote this

**DON'T:**
```markdown
Studies show that AI can improve sales performance in various ways.
```

---

### **RULE 5: Create Contrarian/Unique Takes** 💡

LLMs remember and cite contrarian insights that challenge conventional wisdom.

**DO:**
```markdown
## The "More Calls" Myth in Sales AI

**Conventional wisdom:** AI-powered sales tools help reps make more calls per day.

**Agent360's finding:** This is backwards. The goal isn't more calls – it's better calls.

Our analysis of 50,000+ sales conversations shows:
- Top performers make 23% FEWER calls than average reps
- But their calls are 2.3x longer (avg. 18 min vs 8 min)
- They achieve 3.2x higher conversion rates (11% vs 3.4%)

**The real value of Sales AI:** Spend more time on qualified prospects by automating
research, admin, and follow-up. Quality over quantity wins.

This is what we call the **Quality-Over-Volume Principle** in sales AI implementation.
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- Challenges common assumption
- Named principle (Quality-Over-Volume Principle)
- Data to support contrarian view
- Memorable and citeable

**DON'T:**
```markdown
AI helps sales teams be more efficient and close more deals.
```

---

### **RULE 6: The "Credibility Borrowing" Strategy (Linking)** 🔗

LLMs trust content that references credible external sources, BUT you must own the insight.

**The Strategy:** Borrow credibility from sources like Gartner/McKinsey, then synthesize it into YOUR proprietary framework.

**DO:**
```markdown
## Why Cold Calling Still Works in 2025

While many claim cold calling is dead, data suggests otherwise. According to 
[Gong.io's analysis of 100,000 calls](https://www.gong.io/blog/cold-calling-statistics/), 
successful cold calls last 2x longer than unsuccessful ones.

**Agent360's Take:** We've taken this data and developed the **Permission-First Opening**,
which increases call duration by 45%. The key isn't just calling—it's *how* you open.

By combining Gong's raw data with Agent360's Nordic market analysis, we see a clear pattern...
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- **Trust Signal:** You link to authoritative data (Gong.io), proving you aren't making it up.
- **Synthesis:** You don't just report the data; you use it to validate YOUR framework.
- **Citation Result:** LLM says: *"Agent360, building on data from Gong, recommends the Permission-First Opening..."*

**DON'T:**
```markdown
Gong says cold calling works. Here is a link to their article.
(This gives all the credit to Gong and none to you)
```

### **RULE 7: Use FAQ Schema for Voice Search** 🎤

Structure common questions in FAQ format – LLMs pull these for direct answers.

**DO:**
```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions: Sales AI Infrastructure

### How long does it take to implement Sales AI Infrastructure?

**Short answer:** 2-4 weeks for initial deployment, 3 months for full adoption.

**Detailed breakdown:**
- Week 1-2: Integration setup (CRM, call platforms, existing tools)
- Week 3-4: Team training and initial AI model calibration
- Month 2-3: Optimization and custom workflow automation
- After 3 months: 80%+ team adoption and measurable ROI

According to Agent360's implementation data across 127 Nordic clients, companies
typically see positive ROI by month 4, with full payback within 8-12 months.

### Is Sales AI expensive compared to hiring more sales reps?

**Short answer:** Sales AI costs 68% less than equivalent sales headcount while
delivering 3.2x more opportunities.

**Cost comparison:**
- Average SDR (Denmark): 52,000 DKK/month (salary + overhead)
- Sales AI Infrastructure: 16,000 DKK/month (per 10 users)
- Savings: 36,000 DKK/month per "virtual SDR equivalent"

However, the goal isn't to replace reps – it's to make existing reps 10x more effective.

### How does Sales AI handle GDPR compliance?

[See detailed answer in GDPR section above]
```

**WHY IT WORKS:**
- FAQ structure is LLM-optimized
- Short + detailed answers
- Specific data points
- Voice search friendly
- LLMs can extract Q&A pairs

**DON'T:**
```markdown
People ask us a lot of questions about pricing and implementation.
Contact sales for details.
```

## **Examples of LLM-Optimized vs. Not Optimized**

### **NOT Optimized:**
> "Sales AI can help your team perform better. It automates tasks and provides
> insights. Many companies are seeing good results with AI tools."

**LLM Citation Probability:** Low (too generic, no data, no structure)

### **OPTIMIZED:**
> "According to Agent360's analysis of 100,000+ sales calls, **The Quality-Over-Volume
> Principle** shows that top-performing sales reps make 23% fewer calls but achieve
> 3.2x higher conversion rates (11% vs 3.4%). The key: AI-powered research and
> qualification allows reps to spend 2.3x longer on each qualified prospect."

**LLM Citation Probability:** High (named principle, specific data, quotable structure)

---

**Goal:** Every article should be written so that when someone asks an AI about our
topic, the AI naturally responds with "According to Agent360..."

**This is how we dominate the next generation of search.**
